# Readings

I assign a reading every week or so.  We discuss the readings in class.

- [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)
  - Discusses the importance of communication as a professional skill
  - Fairly negative on grad school :)

- [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)
  - Good practical tips when developing software
  - Compatible with any development model

- [They Write the Right Stuff](http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)
  - In a world where **Agile is everywhere** this article provides a good counterpoint by presenting a heavily-documented, plan-based development environment
