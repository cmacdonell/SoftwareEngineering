# Readings


I assign a reading every week or so.  We discuss the readings in class.

Books
-----

- [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2)
  - Very few software development groups (zero by my count) actually implement every detail of Scrum
  - An easy-to-read, down-to-earth, experiential discussion of using Scrum with teams by a highly experienced Scrum coach.
  - I usually have the students read this about 50 pages at a time and discuss them in class.

Articles
--------

- [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)
  - Discusses the importance of communication as a professional skill
  - Fairly negative on grad school :)


- [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)
  - Good practical tips when developing software
  - Compatible with any development model


- [They Write the Right Stuff](http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)
  - In a world where **Agile is everywhere** this article provides a good counterpoint by presenting a heavily-documented, plan-based development environment
